# Intro to JS

# What is JS?

- not even close to related to Java (JS is to Java as Carpet is to Car)
- If html is what it says and css is what is looks like, then JS is what it does
- JS is a \~\~programming language\~\~
    - HTML and CSS are not (if you wanna get unnessacarily nerdy, html can do a thing that prog. langs do, but w/e). 
        - HTML is a *markup* language
        - CSS is a *style sheet* language

# JS pretty much does...everything, but for us:

JavaScript can change HTML content
JavaScript can change HTML attributes
JavaScript can change CSS style
JavaScript can hide HTML elements
JavaScript can show hidden HTML elements

# Quick note on jargon:

Some jargon is actually terminology. Some is str8 bs.

Important to communicate with fellow devs and debug.

Terrible to communicate ideas.

#### know/note

JS uses **API**s (Application Programming Interfaces) to extend it's capabilities as a prog. lang

"APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to implement programs that would otherwise be hard or impossible to implement." -mdn
#### know/note
---

the most common API? the Browser APIs!

This is what is usually called "vanilla JS"

The other type of API are 3rd party APIs. ie. Twitter allows you to retrieve tweets, Google maps allows you to embed maps.

???
Vanilla is still wildly powerful, https://www.dairyreporter.com/Article/2017/07/07/Vanilla-ranks-as-the-top-selling-ice-cream-flavor-in-US

what you can do with the browser APIs?

- DOM Manipulation!
- Geolocation!
- Draw with Canvas!
- 3D fun with WebGL!
- and more!!!

Let's get dirty and in the details!
